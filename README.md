Hello!

My name is Gregg and I've been using Linux as a hobbyist for 15 years and 4 years professionally. I first got interested in Linux when a classmate of mine in a high school class called *Computer Servicing* (An A+ prep class for the Microsoft exam ironically enough) gave me a burnt CD of [Knoppix](https://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=knoppix), a German Debian distro that was booted into the LiveCD desktop environment. I quickly learned to appreciate just how empowering it was to load my machine up and have complete and easy instant access to all the internals felt. The first thing I used it for was disater recovery. Whenever my Windows machines would have that god awful malwarethat's that's so deeply knit that Windows won't have permission to delete the malware, and the malware scan failed to remove or quarantine the file in question. Knoppix's live CD desktop allowed me to mount the harddrive and delete all the malicious files manually. I enjoyed it so much I went on to install Ubuntu onto my refurbished Dell laptop.  I was proud to have sucessfully followed a `modprobe` tutorial and loaded the driver from the disc that came with the addon PCMCIA WiFi reciever card. The plug-in-play instant and often automatic setup that we now enjoy in modern day Linux wasn't quite there back in the day. But all the manual effort and finger exercising was worth it, I was reminded of using MSDOS, which required me to configure more things myself, but in turn taught me a technical discipline that I now leverage and ejoy for the most rewarding career path. .
