Hello!

My name is Gregg and I've been using Linux as a hobbyist for 15 years and 4 years professionally. I first got interested in Linux when a classmate of mine in a high school class called *Computer Servicing* (An A+ prep class for the Microsoft exam ironically enough) gave me a burnt CD of [Knoppix](https://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=knoppix), a German Debian distro that booted into a LiveCD desktop environment. I quickly learned to appreciate just how empowering it was to have complete, easy and instant access to all of my machines internals felt. IT and Linux has become the most rewarding and emowering career path, I am excited to continue growing in my field and to really hone my DevOps skillset while refining automation and striving to  meld happiness and worflow together.
